# Tutorial on Object SLAM
{: .text-blue}

The goal of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is to construct the representation of an environment while localizing the robot with respect to it. However, this does not provide any understanding of the physical world that the robot is moving in. Such understanding is important for meaning interactions with the world and also results in improved performance for the mapping and localization tasks. This tutorial will introduce the problem of SLAM at it current stage of development and then address various development towards a semantic understanding of the world and its effects on the original SLAM formulation.
