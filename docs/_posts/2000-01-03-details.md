<img class="img-circle" src="img/ela.jpg">

I am a research fellow with the ARC Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision at the Australian National University (ANU). My research interests span from robot vision to advanced techniques for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and 3D reconstruction based on cutting-edge computational tools such as graphical models, modern optimization methods and information theory.

I received the Engineering degree in Industrial Engineering and Automation from the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 2000 and the Ph.D. in Information Technologies from the University of Girona, Spain, in 2005. After the PhD studies, I joined the Robotics group at the Institut de Robótica i Informàtica Industrial, Barcelona, Spain. In 2009 I have been awarded the MICINN/FULBRIGHT post-doctoral fellowship which allowed me to join the group of Prof. Frank Dellaert at College of Computing, Georgia Tech, Atlanta US. In 2010, I joined the robotic group at LAAS-CNRS, Toulouse, France to work in the ROSACE project founded by RTRA-STAE. Between 2012 and 2014 I was research scientist at Brno University of Technology in Czech Republic.

Yasir Latif did his bachelors at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Science and Technology in  Topi, Pakistan and his master in Communication Engineering from Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. After that, he pursued his PhD at University of Zaraogoza, Spain under the supervision of Prof. Jose Neira. He visited Imperial College London and Massachusetts Institute of Technology for short research stays during that period. The main theme of his doctoral thesis was reliable loop closure detection and verification for the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. His interests include SLAM, Computer Vision and looking for the ultimate question.

Vincent is currently a research fellow at Monash University. He did his PhD under the supervision of Professor Tom Drummond at the same university, where he investigated different ways of performing pose estimation and developed efficient and robust techniques for pose estimation in monocular visual odometry and SLAM problems. His research interests lie in the area of SLAM, 3D reconstruction, pose estimation, and augmented reality.
